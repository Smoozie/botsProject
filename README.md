# botsProject
This project contains bots made for the programme IT-Spåret on Ädelfors Folkhögskola.
The bots are deployed to an e2-micro VM instance on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
This VM instance uses Ubuntu 22.04 LTS which currently supports Python version 3.10.
This means that I have hard-coded a strict requirement of Python 3.10 in every bot.

This repository is configured for development in the PyCharm IDE, use it for the optimal development experience.
Unfortunately the bots can't be tested locally, if you wish to test you will need to push changes to this repo in order to run the deployment workflow.
